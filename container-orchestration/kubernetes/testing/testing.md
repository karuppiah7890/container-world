# Testing

I'm going to join a new role in few months. The role will involve
responsibilities with respect to testing and release engineering.

I wanted to understand the different testing tools and testing ecosystem in the
Kubernetes open source ecosystem. So this is me trying out different things
like Prow, Kind etc :)
