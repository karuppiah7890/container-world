# Questions

Some questions I need to answer and learn!

1. Resolution of kubernetes service names including "kubernetes", how does it
exactly happen? Step by step!

2. Connecting from a pod A running on one node N1 to a pod B running on another
node N2, using pod B IP. How does it exactly happen?

3. The networking stuff, like
- Node IPs
- Service IPs
- Pod IPs

How does it all fit in the big picture? 

For example, Node IPs, where are they used?

The ranges of these IPs, how does it effect things, and what happens when there
are no more IPs to allocate?

4. Service to pod load balancing. How does it happen exactly?

5. Kubectl Port forwarding, how does it work?

6. Node Port, how does it work?

7. How are pod/container logs obtained?
